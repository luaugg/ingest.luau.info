# ingest.luau.info

Discord bot which aims to accomplish the following objectives:

* Provide e-sports producers and observers a publish and request URI for game feeds.
* Provide e-sports producers and observers tally light and syncer links, as well as setup instructions for both.
* Automate the provisioning and deployment of ingest servers, including updating DNS records.
* Allow me to conveniently destroy deployed ingest server droplets when I'm done with them.
* Serve as a tool to allow me to learn Rust and bot development again.
